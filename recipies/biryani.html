    <h2>I am from Hyderabad and I would like to share the actual Hyderabad biryani. I have read many biryani recipes but that is not the way we make it.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
        <li>¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
        <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
